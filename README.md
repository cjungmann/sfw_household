# Project SFW_Households

This is a study of one-to-many relationships and how they can
be implemented with the Schema Framework.

The data model will be of households populated with persons.
To simplify the model, the assumption is that each person
has exactly one household, and each household consists of one
or more persons.

This project will have several pages that demonstrate different
strategies for implementing a one-to-many relationship.
